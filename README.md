A file packer.
I don't really remember all details.
It was made years ago to create program students could execute to get an exam subject that would self-destruct if executed anytime outside the exam hour.

I am not sure if it can be still useful: I have created it for a school in which exams took place on student computers, but the concept of the Black Bunny Cavern school implies that school to make computers available throught a login and password, with a total control over it and a specific exam session.
